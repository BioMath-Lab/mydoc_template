A standardised classification system has been developed for impacts of alien taxa (Blackburn et al. 2014, IUCN 2020) and data on impacts are publicly available in databases such as GRIIS. This task will integrate these data with biodiversity data cubes to demonstrate impact for specific case systems and study taxa, feeding into national indicators, impact of specific species, cumulative impact of several species on specific sites (Wilson et al. 2018), and impact risk (McGeoch et al. 2021). We can also provide estimates of invasion debt and forecast potential impacts spatially and temporally (Rouget et al.2016).
